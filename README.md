## Tools Used For Mob Programming:
IntelliJ IDEA CE
Microsoft Teams

Our rationale for using Microsoft Teams for the actual video call was that it provided a seamless way for us to collaborate on a screen share while preserving any discussions during the session in a recording.

We used IntelliJ IDEA CE as our IDE during the session because it provided an easy way for us to visualize the test suite, the code coverage, and actual code implementation all in one window during our screen share.

### Video

During our mob programming session, we added test coverage to the program (97% Line Cov), refactored the business logic to reduce code smell, and implemented a new feature
